  '<article class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
    <h2>Day 0–7: Foundations that actually move the map pin</h2>
    <p><strong>Primary category:</strong> Pick the one that best matches your core revenue (e.g., Pet Sitter, Dog Walker, Pet Groomer).</p>
    <p><strong>Secondary categories:</strong> Add 1–2 (e.g., House Sitting, Dog Day Care).</p>
    <p><strong>Service area:</strong> Add your towns/areas—don't overreach; prioritise where you can serve well.</p>
    <p><strong>Hours & special hours:</strong> Include bank holidays and peak-season notes.</p>
    <p><strong>Attributes:</strong> "Women-led," "LGBTQ+ friendly," "By appointment only," "Online estimates," etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Services list:</strong> Add named services with short, benefits-led descriptions and prices "from £X".</p>
    <p><strong>Photos:</strong> Upload 10–15 good shots (see Pillar 3, Post 4 for the full shot list).</p>
    <p><strong>Tracking:</strong> Use UTM on your website link: ?utm_source=google&utm_medium=gbp&utm_campaign=profile.</p>
    
    <h3>Microcopy examples (paste-ready)</h3>
    <p><strong>Service:</strong> Overnight Pet Sitting (Home Stay) — "12-hour stay, bedtime routine, morning feed, updates via WhatsApp. From £60."</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong> (first 250 chars): "Northampton-based pet sitting, dog walking & grooming with calm handling and clear updates. Fully insured and DBS checked."</p>
    
    <h2>Week 2–4: Nail Posts + "Products"</h2>
    <p>Publish one post per week. Use simple, helpful updates; add a photo; link to a relevant page with UTM.</p>
    <p><strong>GBP Post formula</strong> (150–250 words):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Problem → 2) Your approach → 3) Proof → 4) Soft CTA</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example topics:</strong> "New Puppy Home Visits," "Holiday Travel Sits," "Calm Groom for Nervous Dogs," "Summer Heat Walk Policy."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Products</strong> (acts like mini-landing pages): Add 4–6 "products" for packages you actually sell (e.g., New Puppy Pack, Holiday Travel Pack, Most-Booked Dog Walk). Include price "from £X," 1 photo, and the relevant service page link.</p>
    
    <h2>Week 5–8: Reviews + Q&A (your quiet ranking engine)</h2>
    <p><strong>Review ask</strong> (SMS): "Hi {First Name}, thank you for trusting us with {Pet Name}! If our help made life easier, could you share a quick review? {Short GBP link}. A sentence about the service and your town really helps others find us. Thank you! – {Brand}"</p>
    
    <p><strong>Seed Q&A</strong> (public questions you ask/answer):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Do you cover {Town} on weekends?" → "Yes, weekend cover in {Town} with limited spots—book early during peak dates."</li>
      <li>"How do you handle anxious dogs?" → "Calm handling, slow introductions, and owner-agreed routines; updates after each visit."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add 4–6 genuine FAQs you're asked constantly.</p>
    
    <h2>Week 9–12: Optimise & expand</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add 8–12 fresh photos (work, team, transport, safety).</li>
      <li><strong>Posts:</strong> Switch to seasonal issues (Bonfire Night prep, heat policy, Christmas booking caps).</li>
      <li><strong>Products:</strong> Add one "bundle" (e.g., Holiday Travel Pack) with clear inclusions.</li>
      <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Check GBP Insights + your UTM clicks. Keep what works, drop what's flat.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Reply like a pro (reviews & Q&A)</h2>
    <p><strong>Positive review reply:</strong> "Thank you, {Name}! {Pet Name} did brilliantly with the new routine in {Town}. See you next week."</p>
    <p><strong>Neutral/negative reply:</strong> Acknowledge → 1 fact → next step → invite to DM. Keep it brief and kind.</p>
    
    <h2>What success looks like</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10–20 reviews mentioning service + town.</li>
      <li>Weekly post cadence sustained for 12 weeks.</li>
      <li>Products for your top 4–6 services.</li>

  'Build town pages that aren''t "doorways": unique proof, routes, reviews and offers. Includes a reusable page template + copy examples.',
  '<article class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
    <h2>Why town pages still work (when done properly)</h2>
    <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Each town has specific concerns (parking, parks, commute times, events).</p>
    <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Routes, reviews and photos tie you to the area.</p>
    <p><strong>Conversion:</strong> A single clear next step for locals beats a generic homepage.</p>
    
    <h2>The Town Page Template (copy & adapt)</h2>
    <p><strong>H1:</strong> Pet Sitting & Dog Walking in {Town}, {County}</p>
    <p><strong>Intro</strong> (60–90 words): State what you do, who for, where exactly, and availability (e.g., evenings/weekends).</p>
    
    <h3>Section 1 — How We Serve {Town}</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3–5 concise bullets: common routes or estates, typical visit windows, local parks used.</li>
      <li>1 mini-map image or "route list" (e.g., "Kingsthorpe → Abington Park → back streets for calm walking").</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Section 2 — Prices & Popular Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tiles (Walk 30/45/60; Sit; Puppy Visits) with "from £X" and 1–2 benefit bullets.</li>
      <li>Link to your main pricing page for full details.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Section 3 — Local Proof</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 geo-specific reviews (with initials), one photo from the area (landmark in background).</li>
      <li>"Seen around:" list 2–3 dog-friendly spots (vets, groomers, parks).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Section 4 — FAQs for {Town}</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Parking/access, peak-time availability, key handling.</li>
      <li>"Do you cover {Neighbourhood}?" → keep to real coverage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Section 5 — Simple CTA</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"Check your dates" form or Calendly embed.</li>
      <li>Secondary link: WhatsApp click-to-chat.</li>

      <li>Don't copy the same 300 words to 10 towns.</li>
      <li>Don't list towns you don't really serve.</li>
      <li>Don't stuff place names into unnatural sentences.</li>

    <h2>How to produce town-unique proof quickly</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 route note you actually walk.</li>
      <li>1 local photo taken by you (no stock).</li>
      <li>1 review that mentions the town or estate.</li>
      <li>1 tweak to FAQs (parking/blocks/peak demand).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Internal linking (helps Google + users)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>From the homepage, link to a "Service Areas" hub.</li>
      <li>Cross-link neighbouring towns (e.g., Northampton ↔ Wellingborough).</li>
      <li>Link each town page to a relevant case study/blog post.</li>

  'You don''t need keyword-stuffed reviews—you need natural language that mentions the service, town and result. Here''s how to ask (kindly), what to avoid, and the exact scripts to use.',
  'Get Better Reviews: Natural Keywords for Pet Groomers & Sitters',
  'Ask the right way and clients will naturally mention your service, town and result—no spam. Includes ready-to-send SMS/email scripts and reply templates.',
  '<article class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
    <h2>Why keywords in reviews matter (and how to keep it ethical)</h2>
    <p>Reviews are part of your local prominence. When a client naturally writes "cat sitting in Kingsthorpe" or "nervous dog groom—calm and patient," it helps future clients understand fit—and can improve discovery.</p>
    
    <h2>The "3-Point Ask" (what to prompt)</h2>
    <p>When you request a review, invite—don't script—three specifics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What service did we provide?</li>
      <li>Which area/town were we in?</li>
      <li>What changed for you or your pet?</li>

    <p>"Hi {First Name}, thanks again for trusting us with {Pet Name}. If you've got 30 seconds, a quick review here would mean a lot: {Short GBP link}. It helps to mention the service and your town in your own words. Thank you! – {Brand}"</p>
    
    <h3>Paste-ready Email</h3>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> A quick favour about {Pet Name}?</p>
    <p><strong>Body:</strong><br>
    "Hi {First Name},<br>
    We loved helping {Pet Name} with {Service}. If you're happy to, a short Google review helps other local owners decide. Here's the link: {Short GBP link}.<br>
    Sharing what service we did, your town, and what felt most helpful is perfect (your own words).<br>
    Huge thanks—{Your Name}, {Brand}"</p>
    
    <h2>Make reviewing effortless</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a short link directly to your GBP review form.</li>
      <li>Add the link in email footers and WhatsApp templates.</li>
      <li>Trigger a same-day request while the experience is fresh.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Reply templates (signal you care)</h2>
    <p><strong>Positive:</strong> "Thanks, {Name}! We're so glad the {Service} helped {Pet Name} settle in {Town}. See you soon."</p>
    <p><strong>Constructive:</strong> "Thank you for sharing this, {Name}. We're sorry for {Issue}. We've {Action}. I'll DM you to put this right."</p>
    
    <h2>What not to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't offer cash for reviews; keep incentives ethical (e.g., donate £1 per review to a local rescue).</li>
      <li>Don't write or suggest exact wording—invite themes.</li>
      <li>Don't ask only your happiest clients; ask consistently.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Display reviews on your site (and help conversions)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Show 3–5 rotating snippets on the homepage and the relevant service page.</li>
      <li>Add Schema.org review markup via your CMS/theme where possible.</li>
      <li>Pair a review carousel with a "Book Now" button.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tracking</h2>
    <p><strong>Spreadsheet columns:</strong> Date asked, Channel (SMS/email/WhatsApp), Response (Y/N), Link to review.</p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> 30–50 reviews with natural service + town mentions over 6–9 months.</p>
  </article>',
  '[
    {"q": "How many reviews do I need?", "a": "Aim for steady growth—3–5 new reviews per month—rather than a one-off spike. Consistency beats volume."},
    {"q": "What about negative reviews?", "a": "Reply kindly, state one fact, explain your next step, and invite the customer to continue privately. Readers judge your response as much as the review."},
    {"q": "Can I automate review requests?", "a": "Yes—trigger an SMS/email after a completed booking. Make it easy to opt out and keep the message personal."}

    <p><strong>Cadence:</strong> 2–4 photos per week or a batch of 8–12 monthly.</p>
    <p><strong>Diversity:</strong> Mix people, pets, places and process.</p>
    <p><strong>File names:</strong> Useful for your own organisation (GBP won't read them), e.g., northampton-dog-walk-enrichment.jpg.</p>
    <p><strong>No client?</strong> Practice with staff pets or staged shots until you have consented work.</p>
    
    <h2>Legal & consent (keep it kind)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask permission for pet + human faces; record consent.</li>
      <li>Avoid sensitive locations (house numbers, children).</li>
      <li>Keep animal welfare first in all imagery.</li>

    <h2>Tie photos to posts & products</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pair each GBP post with a fresh photo.</li>
      <li>Add one strong image to each "product" (package) to reinforce value.</li>
      <li>Re-use best shots on your Service-Area pages and Pricing page.</li>
